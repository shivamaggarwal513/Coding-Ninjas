Problem Statement: Does s contain t ?
Problem Level: EASY
Problem Description:
Given two string s and t, write a function to check if s contains all characters of t (in the same order as they are in string t).
Return true or false.
Do it recursively.
E.g. : s = “abchjsgsuohhdhyrikkknddg” contains all characters of t=”coding” in the same order. So function will return true.
Input Format :
Line 1 : String s
Line 2 : String t

Output Format :
true or false

Sample Input 1 :
abchjsgsuohhdhyrikkknddg
coding

Sample Output 1 :

Problem Statement: Maximum Profit on App
Problem Level: MEDIUM
Problem Description:
You have made a smartphone app and want to set its price such that the profit earned is maximised. There are certain buyers who will buy 
your app only if their budget is greater than or equal to your price.
You will be provided with a list of size N having budgets of buyers and you need to return the maximum profit that you can earn.
Lets say you decide that price of your app is Rs. x and there are N number of buyers. So maximum profit you can earn is :
 m * x

where m is total number of buyers whose budget is greater than or equal to x.
Input format :
Line 1 : N (No. of buyers)
Line 2 : Budget of buyers (separated by space)

Output Format :
 Maximum profit

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^6

Sample Input 1 :
4
30 20 53 14

Sample Output 1 :
60

Sample Output 1 Explanation :
Price of your app should be Rs. 20 or Rs. 30. For both prices, you can get the profit Rs. 60.
Sample Input 2 :
5
34 78 90 15 67

Sample Output 2 :
201

Sample Output 2 Explanation :
Price of your app should be Rs. 67. You can get the profit Rs. 201 (i.e. 3 * 67).

Chapter TEST
Problem Statement: Split Array
Problem Level: MEDIUM
Problem Description:
Given an integer array A of size N, check if the input array can be splitted in two parts such that -
- Sum of both parts is equal
- All elements in the input, which are divisible by 5 should be in same group.
- All elements in the input, which are divisible by 3 (but not divisible by 5) should be in other group.
- Elements which are neither divisible by 5 nor by 3, can be put in any group.

Groups can be made with any set of elements, i.e. elements need not to be continuous. And you need to consider each and every 
element of input array in some group.
Return true, if array can be split according to the above rules, else return false.
Note : You will get marks only if all the test cases are passed.
Input Format :
Line 1 : Integer N (size of array)
Line 2 : Array A elements (separated by space)

Output Format :
true or false

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 50

Sample Input 1 :
2
1 2

Sample Output 1 :
false

Sample Input 2 :
3
1 4 3

Sample Output 2 :
true
