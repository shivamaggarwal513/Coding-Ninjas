Coding Problem
Problem Statement: Maximum Frequency Number
Problem Level: EASY
Problem Description:
You are given an array of integers that contain numbers in random order. Write a program to find and return the number which occurs the 
maximum times in the given input.
If two or more elements contend for the maximum frequency, return the element which occurs in the array first.
Input Format:
The first line of input contains an integer, that denotes the value of the size of the array. Let us denote it with the symbol N.
The following line contains N space separated integers, that denote the value of the elements of the array.

Output Format :
The first and only line of output contains most frequent element in the given array.

Constraints:
0 <= N <= 10^8
Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1 :
13
2 12 2 11 12 2 1 2 2 11 12 2 6

Sample Output 1 :
2

Sample Input 2 :
3
1 4 5

Sample Output 2 :
1

Coding Problem
Problem Statement: Array Intersection
Problem Level: MEDIUM
Problem Description:
You have been given two integer arrays/list(ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively. You need to print their intersection; An 
intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value or to put it in other words, when 
there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.
Note :
Input arrays/lists can contain duplicate elements.

The intersection elements printed would be in the order they appear in the first sorted array/list(ARR1).

<br>
Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case or query contains an integer 'N' representing the size of the first array/list.

The second line contains 'N' single space separated integers representing the elements of the first the array/list.

The third line contains an integer 'M' representing the size of the second array/list.

The fourth line contains 'M' single space separated integers representing the elements of the second array/list.

Output format :
For each test case, print the intersection elements in a row, separated by a single space.

Output for every test case will be printed in a separate line.

Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= N <= 10^6
0 <= M <= 10^6

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1 :
2
6
2 6 8 5 4 3
4
2 3 4 7 
2
10 10
1
10

Sample Output 1 :
2 3 4
10

Sample Input 2 :
1
4
2 6 1 2
5
1 2 3 4 2

Sample Output 2 :
1 2 2

Explanation for Sample Output 2 :
Since, both input arrays have two '2's, the intersection of the arrays also have two '2's. The first '2' of first array matches with 
the first '2' of the second array. Similarly, the second '2' of the first array matches with the second '2' if the second array.

Coding Problem
Problem Statement: Pair sum to 0
Problem Level: MEDIUM
Problem Description:
Given a random integer array A of size N. Find and print the count of pair of elements in the array which sum up to 0.
Note: Array A can contain duplicate elements as well.
Input format:
The first line of input contains an integer, that denotes the value of the size of the array. Let us denote it with the symbol N.
The following line contains N space separated integers, that denote the value of the elements of the array.

Output format :
The first and only line of output contains the count of pair of elements in the array which sum up to 0.

Constraints :
0 <= N <= 10^4
Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:
5
2 1 -2 2 3

Sample Output 1:
2
