Problem Statement: Islands
Problem Level: MEDIUM
Problem Description:
An island is a small piece of land surrounded by water . A group of islands is said to be connected if we can reach from any given 
island to any other island in the same group . Given V islands (numbered from 1 to V) and E connections or edges between islands. 
Can you count the number of connected groups of islands.
Input Format :
The first line of input contains two integers, that denote the value of V and E.
Each of the following E lines contains two integers, that denote that there exists an edge between vertex a and b.

Output Format :
Print the count the number of connected groups of islands

Constraints :
0 <= V <= 1000
0 <= E <= (V * (V-1)) / 2
0 <= a <= V - 1
0 <= b <= V - 1
Time Limit: 1 second

Sample Input 1:
5 8
0 1
0 4
1 2
2 0

Problem Statement: Coding Ninjas
Problem Level: EASY
Problem Description:
Given a NxM matrix containing Uppercase English Alphabets only. Your task is to tell if there is a path in the given matrix which 
makes the sentence “CODINGNINJA” .
There is a path from any cell to all its neighbouring cells. For a particular cell, neighbouring cells are those cells that share 
an edge or a corner with the cell.
Input Format :
The first line of input contains two space separated integers N and M, where N is number of rows and M is the number of columns in 
the matrix. 
Each of the following N lines contain M characters. Please note that characters are not space separated.

Output Format :
Print 1 if there is a path which makes the sentence “CODINGNINJA” else print 0.

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= M <= 1000
Time Limit: 1 second

Sample Input 1:
2 11
CXDXNXNXNXA
XOXIXGXIXJX

Sample Output 1:
1

Problem Statement: Connecting Dots
Problem Level: EASY
Problem Description:
Gary has a board of size NxM. Each cell in the board is a coloured dot. There exist only 26 colours denoted by uppercase Latin 
characters (i.e. A,B,...,Z). Now Gary is getting bored and wants to play a game. The key of this game is to find a cycle that 
contain dots of same colour. Formally, we call a sequence of dots d1, d2, ..., dk a cycle if and only if it meets the following 
condition:
1. These k dots are different: if i ≠ j then di is different from dj.
2. k is at least 4.
3. All dots belong to the same colour.
4. For all 1 ≤ i ≤ k - 1: di and di + 1 are adjacent. Also, dk and d1 should also be adjacent. Cells x and y are called adjacent 
if they share an edge.

Since Gary is colour blind, he wants your help. Your task is to determine if there exists a cycle on the board.
Input Format :
The first line of input contains two space separated integers N and M, where N is number of rows and M is the number of columns 
of the board. 
Each of the following N lines contain M characters. Please note that characters are not space separated. Each character is an 
uppercase Latin letter.

Output Format :
Print true if there is a cycle in the board, else print false.

Constraints :
2 <= N <= 1000
2 <= M <= 1000
Time Limit: 1 second

Sample Input 1:
3 4
AAAA
ABCA
AAAA

Sample Output 1:
true

Problem Statement: Largest Piece
Problem Level: MEDIUM
Problem Description:
It's Gary's birthday today and he has ordered his favourite square cake consisting of '0's and '1's . But Gary wants the biggest 
piece of '1's and no '0's . A piece of cake is defined as a part which consist of only '1's, and all '1's share an edge with each 
other on the cake. Given the size of cake N and the cake, can you find the count of '1's in the biggest piece of '1's for Gary ?
Input Format :
The first line of input contains an integer, that denotes the value of N. 
Each of the following N lines contain N space separated integers.

Output Format :
Print the count of '1's in the biggest piece of '1's, according to the description in the task.

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 1000
Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:
2
1 1
0 1

Sample Output 1:
3

Chapter Assignment
Problem Statement: 3 Cycle
Problem Level: MEDIUM
Problem Description:
Given a graph with N vertices (numbered from 0 to N-1) and M undirected edges, then count the distinct 3-cycles in the graph. A 
3-cycle PQR is a cycle in which (P,Q), (Q,R) and (R,P) are connected by an edge.
Input Format :
The first line of input contains two space separated integers, that denotes the value of N and M.
Each of the following M lines contain two integers, that denote the vertices which have an undirected edge between them. Let us 
denote the two vertices with the symbol u and v.

Output Format :
Print the count the number of 3-cycles in the given graph

Constraints :
0 <= N <= 100
0 <= M <= (N*(N-1))/2
0 <= u <= N - 1
0 <= v <= N - 1
Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:
