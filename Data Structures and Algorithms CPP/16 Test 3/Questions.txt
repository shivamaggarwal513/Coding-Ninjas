Chapter TEST
Problem Statement: Check cousins
Problem Level: MEDIUM
Problem Description:
Given the binary Tree and two nodes say ‘p’ and ‘q’. Determine whether the two nodes are cousins of each other or not. Two nodes are 
said to be cousins of each other if they are at same level of the Binary Tree and have different parents.
Do it in O(n).
Input format :
Line 1 : Nodes in level order form (separated by space). If any node does not have left or right child, take -1 in its place
Line 2 : integer value of p 
Line 3 : Integer value of q

Output format :
true or false

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^5

Sample Input :
5 6 10 2 3 4 -1 -1 -1 -1 9 -1 -1 -1 -1
2
4

Sample Output :
true

Problem Statement: Longest Leaf to root path
Problem Level: MEDIUM
Problem Description:
Given a binary tree, return the longest path from leaf to root. Longest means, a path which contain maximum number of nodes from leaf 
to root.
Input format :
Elements in level order form (separated by space)
(If any node does not have left or right child, take -1 in its place)
Line 1 : Binary Tree 1 (separated by space)

Sample Input 1 :
 5 6 10 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 9 -1 -1

Sample Output 1 :
9
3
6
5

Chapter TEST
Problem Statement: Remove leaf nodes in Tree
Problem Level: MEDIUM
Problem Description:
Remove all leaf nodes from a given generic Tree. Leaf nodes are those nodes, which don't have any children.
Note : Root will also be a leaf node if it doesn't have any child. You don't need to print the tree, just remove all leaf nodes and 
return the updated root.
Input format :
Line 1 : Elements in level order form separated by space (as per done in class). Order is - `

Root_data, n (No_Of_Child_Of_Root), n children, and so on for every element `

Output Format :
Elements are printed level wise, each level in new line (separated by space)

Sample Input 1 :
10 3 20 30 40 2 40 50 0 0 0 0

Sample Output 1 : (Level wise, each level in new line)
10
20
