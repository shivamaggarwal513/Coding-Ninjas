Problem Statement: Find a Node in Linked List
Problem Level: EASY
Problem Description:
You have been given a singly linked list of integers. Write a function that returns the index/position of an integer data denoted by 'N' 
(if it exists). Return -1 otherwise.
Note :
Assume that the Indexing for the singly linked list always starts from 0.

Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case or query contains the elements of the singly linked list separated by a single space.

The second line contains the integer value 'N'. It denotes the data to be searched in the given singly linked list.

Remember/Consider :
While specifying the list elements for input, -1 indicates the end of the singly linked list and hence, would never be a list element.

Output format :
For each test case/query, return the index/position of 'N' in the singly linked list. Return -1, otherwise.

Output for every test case will be printed in a separate line.

Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= M <= 10^5
Where 'M' is the size of the singly linked list.

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1 :
2
3 4 5 2 6 1 9 -1
5
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 -1
6

Sample Output 1 :
2
-1

Sample Input 2 :
1
3 4 5 2 6 1 9 -1
6

Sample Output 2 :
4

Explanation for Sample Input 2 :
For the given singly linked list, considering the indices starting from 0, progressing in a left to right manner with a jump of 1, 
then the N = 6 appears at position 4.

Problem Statement: AppendLastNToFirst
Problem Level: EASY
Problem Description:
You have been given a singly linked list of integers along with an integer 'N'. Write a function to append the last 'N' nodes towards 
the front of the singly linked list and returns the new head to the list.
Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case or query contains the elements of the singly linked list separated by a single space.

The second line contains the integer value 'N'. It denotes the number of nodes to be moved from last to the front of the singly linked 
list.

Remember/Consider :
While specifying the list elements for input, -1 indicates the end of the singly linked list and hence, would never be a list element.

Output format :
For each test case/query, print the resulting singly linked list of integers in a row, separated by a single space.

Output for every test case will be printed in a seperate line.

Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= M <= 10^5
0 <= N < M
Time Limit: 1sec

Where 'M' is the size of the singly linked list.

Sample Input 1 :
2
1 2 3 4 5 -1
3
10 20 30 40 50 60 -1
5

Sample Output 1 :
3 4 5 1 2
20 30 40 50 60 10

Sample Input 2 :
1
10 6 77 90 61 67 100  -1
4

Sample Output 2 :
90 61 67 100 10 6 77

Explanation to Sample Input 2 :
We have been required to move the last 4 nodes to the front of the list. Here, "90->61->67->100" is the list which represents the 
last 4 nodes. When we move this list to the front then the remaining part of the initial list which is, "10->6->77" is attached after 
100. Hence, the new list formed with an updated head pointing to 90.

Problem Statement: Eliminate duplicates from LL
Problem Level: EASY
Problem Description:
You have been given a singly linked list of integers where the elements are sorted in ascending order. Write a function that removes 
the consecutive duplicate values such that the given list only contains unique elements and returns the head to the updated list.
Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

The first and the only line of each test case or query contains the elements(in ascending order) of the singly linked list separated 
by a single space.

Remember/Consider :
While specifying the list elements for input, -1 indicates the end of the singly linked list and hence, would never be a list element.

Output format :
For each test case/query, print the resulting singly linked list of integers in a row, separated by a single space.

Output for every test case will be printed in a seperate line.

Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= M <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1sec

Where 'M' is the size of the singly linked list.

Sample Input 1 :
1
1 2 3 3 4 3 4 5 4 5 5 7 -1

Sample Output 1 :
1 2 3 4 3 4 5 4 5 7

Sample Input 2 :
2
10 20 30 40 50 -1
10 10 10 10 -1

Sample Output 2 :
10 20 30 40 50

Problem Statement: Print Reverse LinkedList
Problem Level: EASY
Problem Description:
You have been given a singly linked list of integers. Write a function to print the list in a reverse order.
To explain it further, you need to start printing the data from the tail and move towards the head of the list, printing the head data 
at the end.
Note :
You canâ€™t change any of the pointers in the linked list, just print it in the reverse order.

Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

The first and the only line of each test case or query contains the elements of the singly linked list separated by a single space.

Remember/Constraints :
While specifying the list elements for input, -1 indicates the end of the singly linked list and hence, would never be a list element.

Output format :
For each test case, print the singly linked list of integers in a reverse fashion, in a row, separated by a single space.

Output for every test case will be printed in a seperate line.

Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= M <= 10^3
Time Limit: 1sec

Where 'M' is the size of the singly linked list.

Sample Input 1 :
1
1 2 3 4 5 -1

Sample Output 1 :
5 4 3 2 1

Sample Input 2 :
2
1 2 3 -1
10 20 30 40 50 -1

Sample Output 2 :
3 2 1

Problem Statement: Palindrome LinkedList
Problem Level: EASY
Problem Description:
You have been given a head to a singly linked list of integers. Write a function check to whether the list given is a 'Palindrome' or 
not.
Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

First and the only line of each test case or query contains the the elements of the singly linked list separated by a single space.

Remember/Consider :
While specifying the list elements for input, -1 indicates the end of the singly linked list and hence, would never be a list element.

Output format :
For each test case, the only line of output that print 'true' if the list is Palindrome or 'false' otherwise.

Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= M <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1sec

Where 'M' is the size of the singly linked list.

Sample Input 1 :
1
9 2 3 3 2 9 -1

Sample Output 1 :
true

Sample Input 2 :
2
0 2 3 2 5 -1
-1

Sample Output 2 :
false
true

Explanation for the Sample Input 2 :
For the first query, it is pretty intuitive that the the given list is not a palindrome, hence the output is 'false'.

For the second query, the list is empty. An empty list is always a palindrome , hence the output is 'true'.
